\section{Test}
This section contains all the test-cases we have deviced to show that the program can successfully complete all the requirements. 

\subsection{Causal ordering}
\paragraph*{Ordering}
This test is to show that the causal ordering module works. The expected result is that all messages that are delivered are in causal order (See example \ref{ex:1}).
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Activate reordering of messages.
	\item Send 4 messages to fill reordering buffer.
	\item Start sending messages while watching the hold-back queue to make sure all messages are held back and delivered correctly. 
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Joining a group in progress}
This test is to show that a new member which joins a group after messages has been sent will not be left out due to not having an up to date vector clock when joining. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Create 2 clients and join the same group with them.
	\item Send atleast 1 message from each, making sure the other receives it. 
	\item Create a third client and join the same group again. 
	\item Check the comparation vector clock on the third client. Should be the same as the clock in the two other clients. 
	\item Send message from one of the two original clients. Should be received in the new one. 
\end{enumerate}
